# Nebula Certifications

To keep synchronized with the fast-paced development of Nebula Graph and its ecosystem and show your expertise in them, you can always participate in the Nebula Certifications.

Nebula certifications have two levels:

* Nebula Graph Certified Insider (NGCI)
    * Obtaining NGCI shows that you are a qualified user with a good understanding of Nebula Graph.
    * The NGCI test consists of 100 questions with a total score of 100: 40 single-choice questions and 60 true-or-false questions.
* Nebula Graph Certified Professional (NGCP)
    * Obtaining NGCP shows that you are a professional with a profound understanding of Nebula Graph.
    * The NGCP test consists of 100 questions with a total score of 100: 40 single-choice questions, 30 multiple-choice questions, and 30 true or false questions.

A score of 60 or above grants you the NGCI/NGCP certificate.
